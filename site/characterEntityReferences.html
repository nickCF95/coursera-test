    <p>For example, if i want to represent the symbol less than o greater than, i'll need to use the next characters: &lt; and &gt;.</p>
    <p>On another hand, too some useful characters are the next:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&amp;</li>
        <li>&copy;</li>
        <li>&quot;</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, we can appreciate that the last character in the example list, does not appear, or it is like a white space, and that's right, but its function is special, and its meaning literally is <q>no breaking space</q>, so for example if we shorten the window width of browser, normally the last word that doesn't fit in this new shorter width would go to the next line, but with that character if i want to keep together two or more words, even a complete sentence, i&nbsp;can&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. Example:&nbsp;"Let's do it". Like you notice, despite there is still a small space in the above line, i have chosen to keep together the sentence of the example. </p>
    <p>Oh before i forget it, the next entity is a white space &#8198 &#8198 &#8198, yeah of course it is.</p>
