    <h1>About Ethics and Morals</h1>
    <h2>Ethics</h2>
    <p>Ethics, also called moral philosophy, the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad and 
    morally right and wrong. The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles.</p>
    <h2>Moral</h2>
    <p>In the normative sense, “morality” refers to a code of conduct that would be accepted by anyone who meets
     certain intellectual and volitional conditions, almost always including the condition of being rational. That
     a person meets these conditions is typically expressed by saying that the person counts as a moral agent. 
     However, merely showing that a certain code would be accepted by any moral agent is not enough to show that
     the code is the moral code. It might well be that all moral agents would also accept a code of prudence or 
     rationality, but this would not by itself show that prudence was part of morality.</p>
